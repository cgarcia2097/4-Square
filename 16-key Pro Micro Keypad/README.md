# When programming the controller 

## Creating the Arduino environment:
Since this PCB uses a Pro Micro for its controller, one must to go Sparkfun's Pro Micro installation tutorial and install drivers for the Pro Micro. Afterwards, in `Tools` -> `Boards`, select `Sparkfun Pro Micro`

## Using the Keyboard and Bounce libraries:
When making edits to the code given or writing from scratch, please use the `Keyboard.h` and `Bounce2.h` libraries. The Keyboard library handles the keyboard functionality, while the Bounce2 library handles switch debounce.

## To-do
* Build Guides
* Code cleanup and explanation
* Repository organization
* Photos/videos of the keypad
* Let me know
